# PeriodicName
PeriodicName is a small project inspired by a common exercise given to kids learning chemistry.
In an effort to help them learn the elements of the table, they are to write out their name using
a combination of elements.  After running across this little exercise my first thought was that 
it could be done programmatically.  Therefore, I set out to build an application that would take
a user's name and output the possible combinations of elements that could constitute it.  


This has been my first foray into programming a real application completely from scratch.  I have
avoided looking to other applications that serve this purpose.  I started the process while working
on the Udacity course JavaScript Design Patterns, and about halfway through programming it realized 
that I was writing spaghetti.  I have left the spaghetti commented out at the bottom as a reminder 
to myself, and a reference for how far I've come.

I decided, after working on the project quite a bit, that it deserved a repo on my account.
I hope that if you're looking at this you enjoy my little application.  Hopefully you don't find
my coding/commenting practices too horrendous.
